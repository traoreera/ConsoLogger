# ConsoLogger

## Overview

ConsoLogger is a Python-based tool for analyzing and diagnosing electrical consumption. It reads data from the INA219 sensor and records it in a CSV file. The tool provides various features, including Kalman filtering to reduce noise and predictions for future consumption.

## Features

- Serial communication with INA219 sensor
- Data logging to a CSV file
- Kalman filtering for voltage, current, and power
- Statistical analysis of consumption data
- Graph plotting with predicted values
- Battery autonomy estimation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure the serial port, baud rate, and other parameters in the `ConsoLogger` class or via the Flet UI.
2. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```
3. Follow on-screen instructions to start measurements and view results.

## Components

- **ConsoLogger**: The main class responsible for reading data, filtering, and analysis.
- **Flet UI**: Provides a graphical interface to configure parameters and view results.
- **Kalman Filter**: Used for smoothing the data.

## Testing

Unit tests are available in the `src/tests` directory. Run tests using:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s src/tests
```
